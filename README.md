# JSRequests_GET_POST
A reference repo illustrating JS XHR GET-POST request syntax. 
Contains 4 files per project, including main project, helper functions, css styles, and and index.html.

"Rhyme" project gets words that rhyme with an input word. 
-GET requests receive information from other sources (rhyming words).

"Rebrandly" project returns a shortened url.
-POST requests can introduce new information to other sources (in this case a long http address) in addition to requesting it (requesting a short url).
